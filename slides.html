      # What is AI?

      Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that involves the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the human activities that could be programmed using artificial intelligence include:

      - Computer vision: ability of computers to identify objects, scenes, and activities in images
      - Natural Language Processing: ability of computers to understand meaning from text or generating text that is readable
      - Speech Processing: automatically transcribing human speech or generating speech from the corresponding text

            # Where is AI used today?
            Despite it seeming like a technology far off into the future, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are part of many of the tools we use every day. Here are just a few: 

            **Google Maps** uses AI to update addresses and street names based on street view pictures. 

            **Facebook** uses AI to analyze text posted by users and better suggest ads they may need or be interested in. It also uses AI to analyse photos and identify faces.

            **Amazon** uses AI for it’s suggested purchases predicting algorithm.

                  # History of AI: Notable Women

                  While the AI sector has been historically dominated by men, women are also making contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Some of them work right here, in Canada. 
                  
                  In 2005, four women, Hanna Wallach, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Lisa Wainer, and Angela Yu, attending the Neural Information Systems Processing (NIPS) conference, decided to organize the first "Women in Machine Learning Conference". The conference has now been running for over 10 years and WiML has a directory of women in Machine Learning, 1000 women strong. 

                  ![Women in ML across the world](framework/img/workshop/women-in-machine-learning.png)

  
                  ## These are just a few of the amazing women working in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Canada and around the world: 
                  
                  ![Nancy Reid](framework/img/workshop/nancy-reid.jpg)
                  Dr. Nancy Reid is a University Professor of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.

                        # Why should you care? 

                        ## We need to solve the problems of each of us, not just the loudest amongst us.

                        As AI becomes more and more integrated in every day life, we need to ensure that everyone in society and their needs are being met by the AI that we build. We all need to care about being represented in the datasets and algorithms being used in AI today so that the machines that are made to help humanity, also help us. 
                        
                        ##Without women and minorities, AI can have terrible consequences: 

                        - When Siri was first introduced into the iPhone it was not able to understand women's voices because it had only been trained with male voices. 
                        - An AI system designed by Northpointe in the US to predict the likelihood that an alleged offender will commit another crim in the future was shown to demonstrate racial bias in its predictions.

                        ## Women stand to lose more in an automated world: 
                        - According to the World Economic Forum, "twice as many women than men are likely to lose their jobs as automation replaces human labor." This is due to the fact that most jobs that can be automated are held by women. (e.g. cash registers)

                        ## Because AI is amazing
                        - We should also care because AI is a fascinating field of discovery that we can be a part of today. So why not get involved?

                      # What is Data

                        Data is everything. More specifically, data is information. 

                        - As humans we start interpreting data from the moment we're born. As soon as we perceive the world around us for the first time, we are collecting and processing data.
                        - Data is also being collected all the time about our own actions and interactions by others
                        - Can you think of examples of when and where data about you is collected on a regular basis?
                          - stores ?
                          - government ?
                          - websites ?
                          - satellites ?

            # What are databases? 
            Databases are where data is saved and organized. Here are some examples of databases you might have seen before:

            1. The Old School Rolodex
            (These were used to keep addresses organized in the old days when cell phones didn’t exist.)

            ![rolodex](framework/img/workshop/rolodex.jpg)

            2. The Spreadsheet (You may have seen one on Excel, Google Sheets or Numbers)

              #Database Files

                Databases can be saved in various formats.

                Today we will be using datasets saved as **CSV files** (filename.csv) . CSV stands for *Comma Separated Values* because rows of data are saved separated by commas. 

                CSV files are really useful because they enable you to easily transfer data from one program to another. 

                We’ve been using Google Sheets so far but soon we’ll want to look at our data using data analysis software and CSV is compatible with it and most similar software.

                Let's compare: 

                1. Data in our table: 
                ![starter db](framework/img/workshop/spreadsheet.png)

                2. Data in a csv file: 
                ```CSV
                Age Range,Weekly Hours of TV,Weekly Hours on Social Media,Favourite Color,Favourite Protein,Favourite Film Genre,Favourite Music Genre,Favourite Pet

              Today we will be using Dataiku to visualize and analyze our datasets. Dataiku is a platform that enables us to analyse our data and (later), run machine learning algorithms on our data, using a friendly Graphical User Interface(GUI). If we want, it also allows us to look behind the interface at the code itself to make changes. 

              Today, we will be doing both.

                  # Exercise 2: Installing Dataiku on an Apple Computer (10 mins)
                  (See next slide for PC)

                  1. Go to [https://www.dataiku.com/](https://www.dataiku.com/)
                  1. We will be installing the Free version of DataIku if you have a Mac. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Install ![install button](framework/img/workshop/dataiku-install-button.png)
                  1. Next, we’ll want to choose Apple as our operating system. 
                  1. Download the dmg file
                  1. Open the DMG file and drop the application into the Applications folder.
                  1. Open up the application by finding it with Spotlight or clicking on its icon in the Applications folder. 
                  1. You may need to authorize Dataiku to run on your OS. If so, Open System Preferences, go to "Security & Privacy" and authorize the application
                  DSS opens automatically in your browser (only Chrome and Firefox are supported). To reopen DSS, click on the DSS logo in the menubar or browse to [http://localhost:11200](localhost:11200)

            # Exercise 2: Installing Dataiku on a Windows Computer (10 mins)

            ## For Windows computers, we’ll be using the Virtual Box option since Dataiku only runs locally on Linux and Apple computers. 
            1. Download Virtual Box from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
            1. Select the Windows hosts version. 
            1. Once it’s finished downloading, run the .exe file to install Virtual Box.
            1. Download the DSS virtual machine 
            1. Open it in Virtualbox (either by double-clicking or using File > Import Appliance)
            1. The Appliance import wizard opens. You should not need to change any setting. Simply click on Import.
            1. Once the virtual machine is imported, click on Start. The virtual machine boots.
            1. Once the Virtual Machine has finished booting, it displays a welcome banner with connection details.
            1. You do not need to login into the virtual machine. Open your regular Chrome or Firefox browser (ie: not in the virtual machine). In that browser, open the URL that is displayed in the welcome banner, as "Data Science Studio interface". The DSS interface appears. This URL to open is often http://127.0.0.1:10000 (but not always, please check the welcome banner).

           # What goes in a database?

           What kinds of information can we add to a database? If information is EVERYTHING, how do we store that in a computer in a way that it will understand? 
           
           There are established **types** of data that we can define in a database. For example:

            - Integer (int, whole numbers)
            - Float (float, numbers containing decimals)
            - String (str, words, sentences, literal text)
            - Boolean (True, False)
            - Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a jpeg image file.

          ## Integers (Int)
          These are whole numbers (no decimals). E.g. The number of attendees that came to your party = 35.
          ## Float(float)
          These are decimal numbers. E.g. Usain Bolt’s 100m world-record-breaking running speed: 9.58 seconds.
          ## String (str)
          Strings are words, sentences or text. E.g. Your favourite colour: “Red”
          ## Booleans 
          True or False. E.g. Are you attending your friend’s wedding? Yes(True). 
          ## Bytes and byte arrays
          This datatype is used for images such as jpegs.

              # Class Exercise: Our First Dataiku Project

              Now that we have an account in Dataiku, let's import the csv file we created in Google Sheets into our first Dataiku project. 

              1. Go to dataiku. (http://localhost:11200 on a mac and most likely  http://127.0.0.1:10000 if you’re on Virtual Machine. If you have the cloud edition, just go back to the dataiku website where you left off)
              1. Select the plus sign on the left hand corner to create a new project. ![new project](framework/img/workshop/new-project-plus.png)
              1. Give your project a name. E.g. “My first Data project”
              ![project name](framework/img/workshop/new_project_name.png)
              1. Import your first dataset. (this is the CSV file we created in Google Sheets) ![import button](framework/img/workshop/import-first-dataset.png)
              1. There are lots of ways to import datasets. We want to click on “Upload Files” under “Files”. 
              1. Select the CSV file you created earlier in Google Sheets. You’ll be able to preview it right away.
              1. Click Create to finish the import. ![create](framework/img/workshop/create-dataset.png)
              
              Here's an animation of the process of uploading your dataset:

                  Now it’s time to explore the data! 

                  1. Once you click create, you should be sent directly the table of data with the exploration menu at the top. If not, click on the “Data sets” icon from the dashboard. 
                  1. The dataset should open and enable you to explore using the exploration menu above it. 
                  1. On the menu above it click on "Explore" ![data dashboard menu](framework/img/workshop/explore-menu.png)
                  1. In the Explore tab you can see all of your data in table format. In the top row you’ll see that every single column is first recognized as a string. This is because all CSV file values are stored as strings. Below the String you’ll see the actual data type DataIku will recognize for each of your columns. Are they all correct? Check against the data type definitions we talked about eariler. 
                  1. Create a chart! If you go into the Charts tab you can start playing around with some data visualization! The default chart is a Histogram Bar Graph. You can change the type of graph you want by clicking on the graph-type dropdown. ![graph-dropdown](framework/img/workshop/graph-type-dropdown.png)
                  1. You’ll notice that some chart fields can only be filled with numerical columns. For instance, the Y column of your bar graph, must be a numerical data type for it to work. Play around with the columns and charts and see if there's any correlation between them! Have fun!

                      # What is Big Data? 

                      There is controversy in the field as to what Big Data really means. For some Big Data must meet certain volume (very large amounts), velocity (it's often available in real-time and requires extremely rapid analysis) and variety (it contains very complex data types).

                      Here are definitions of Big Data by 3 scholars in the field who were asked by the Berkely School of Information: 

                      <blockquote>
                      Big data is an opportunity to gain a more complex understanding of the relationships between different factors and to uncover previously undetected patterns in data by leveraging advances in the technical aspects of collecting, storing, and retrieving data along with innovative ideas and techniques for manipulating and analyzing data.
                        <cite>Amy Escobar, Data Scientist, 2U Inc.</cite>

                      </blockquote>
                      <blockquote>
                      Big data is when data grows to the point that the technology supporting the data has to change. It also encompasses a variety of topics relating to how disparate data can be combined, processed into insights, and/or reworked into smart products. <cite>Anna Smith, Analytics Engineer, Rent the Runway,@OMGannaks </cite>

                        - Learners turns this around: in goes the data and the desired result and **out comes the model** that turns one into the other.
                        - Learners are algorithms that make models **capture decision and action rules**.

                        ### Notes
                        Machine learning refers to the ability of computer systems to improve their performance by exposure to data without the need to follow explicitly programmed instructions. At its core, machine learning is the process of automatically discovering patterns in data. Once discovered, the pattern can be used to make predictions. For instance, presented with a database of information about credit card transactions, such as date, time, merchant, merchant location, price, and whether the transaction was legitimate or fraudulent, a machine learning system learns patterns that are predictive of fraud. The more transaction data it processes, the better its predictions are expected to become.

                                      F is similar to a teacher who knows the right answers

                                      Goal: Minimize the error between f predictions and actual outcomes

                                      Ideal case: minimize the error on all possible inputs 

                                      Real case: we have limited set of instances with their corresponding outcomes

      # Deep Learning

      ![deep learning visual](framework/img/workshop/deep-learning-pic.png)

      - Deep neural networks are a subtype of supervised learning. 
      - Deep networks are multilayer networks on top of each other where each layer corresponds to a different level of abstraction.
      - There are two main reasons behind the popularity and the high impact of deep neural networks in various fields such as computer vision and speech recognition:
      - The emergence of modern parallel computing architectures providing low-cost and fast computation for a large number of parameters of the deep networks.
      - The availability of vast amounts of images, video, speech and text on the Internet providing sufficient data for training these networks.
      - Each layer in the deep architecture provides a nonlinear information processing. 
      - The output is a parameterized function of the inputs and the output of each layer is the input for the higher layer.

                # Data Collection
                Collecting and preparing the INPUT and the OUTCOME are the most important steps in solving problems using machine learning

                In supervised ML, the model learns from the labeled instances that we feed into the model. The trained model can later be used to predict the outcome of data that you do not have the answer for. 

                ## Each instance in your data must contain two elements:

                - **Input** - The raw input that should be mapped to numerical values as variables/features 
                - **Outcome** – what you want your model to predict. 

                ## Sources for labeled data:

                - **Experienced data:** Historical data captured from processes with inputs and outcomes.
                - **Human Annotation:** Providing input to human annotators and ask for the labels

                    The performance of machine learning models significantly depends on the representation of the data 

                    Each piece of information included in the representation of the input is called a feature.

                    **Example:** Representing a patient- doctor examines the patient, measure blood pressure, body temperature, take MRI, CT scan, blood sugar test and provide these information to AI system as feature input

                        Pre-processing and cleaning data are important tasks that must be applied before using data to train an ML model

                        Why? To avoid "garbage in, garbage out"

                        ## The problems with raw data

                        - Incomplete: having missing values for different attributes per records
                        - Noisy: non-correct values for some attributes, outliers
                        - Inconsistent
                        
                        ## Preprocessing Steps: 
                        - **Data cleaning:** fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.
                        - **Data integration:** using multiple databases, data cubes, or files.
                        - **Data transformation:** normalization and aggregation.
                        - **Data reduction:** reducing the volume but producing the same or similar analytical results.
                        - **Data discretization:** part of data reduction, replacing numerical attributes with nominal ones.

                            1. Click on Import Dataset. From the project folder choose the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance file. It looks like a zip file but when you upload it it will become csv. 
                            1. Click on the create button to finalize the import. 
                            1. Ensure that all of the column names have been imported properly. 
                            1. Ensure that all data-types have been identified correctly. **Tip:** There is a mistake on one of the columns! Here's a clue: ![clue](framework/img/workshop/clue.png)

                                    ## How to evaluate the quality of learned model?

                                    - The data is split into two subsets:
                                         1. A training and validation set used only to find the right function predicator
                                         2. A test set used to report the prediction error of the model
                                    - These sets must be disjoint!
                                    - Normally, we use 70% of data as Training and validation set and the rest as test set
                                    - In case of having smaller datasets, we use cross-validation

                    ## Data Types in Python

                    The previous example used the *integer* number **type** but there are many more.

                    * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
                    * Float (`float`, numbers containing decimals)
                    * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
                    * Boolean (`True`, `False`)
                    * [and many more!](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html)
                    
                    To display the type, use `type()` and a data value inside the parentheses.

                    ```
                    >>> type("hello")
                    <type 'str'>

                    >>> type(42)
                    <type 'int'>

                    >>> type(3.14159)
                    <type 'float'>
                    ```

                    ## Functions in Python

                    * Functions are bundles of instructions that can be re-used
                    * Reusing functions helps to reduce redundancy
                    * Function can take **arguments** and can **return** values
                    
                    e.g. the `add` function takes `a` and `b` as arguments and will **return** the result

                    ```python
                    >>> def add(a, b):
                    ...     return a + b
                    ...
                    >>> add(1, 2)
                    3
                    >>> add(3, 4)
                    7
                    ```
                    
                    It is possible to create your own but today's exercises will use functions provided by Python and its libraries.

                        # Python AI Libraries

                        There are a number of helpful Python libraries that make it easier to work with data and machine learning. Code libraries are pre-written code functions that help you quickly accomplish complicated tasks without having to write all your code from scratch. The **sklearn** library is a robust AI library that we'll be working with today.

                        So far we've worked with a Graphical User Interface on Dataiku. This is what you would have to do if to accomplish the same thing using just Python code: 

                        1. Using sklearn platform.
                        1. Loading the dataset
                        1. Initial Preprocessing of the data
                        1. Creating Training and Test sets
                        1. Preprocessing: Filling missing values, Handling Categorical Features, Normalizing numerical Features
                        1. Choose the Classifier mode
                        1. Train a Classifier using train set
                        1. Evaluate the learned model
                        1. Making some predictions

                        1. Go to Deploy, Jupyter notebook
                        1. Map each of the steps in previous slide to a cell in Jupyter notebook
                        1. Run all cells and check the output of each cell

                        In this exercise everyone will get back into groups of 3 and you will manipulate the code inside Jupyter using the Python sklearn library documentation. 

                        1. Switch the Random Forest classifier model to use Logistic Regression. **Hot Tip**: Refer to the [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
                        2. Train and test the new model - does the result improve? 
                        3. Change the evaluation metric to have F-score. Again, use the [documentation for f-score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html
                        4. Change the parameters of the LR classifier like solver, Regularization penalty, inverse of regularization strength C and investigate the effect of these changes in the performance of the model. (Reference to these paremeters are in the first documentation link at #1)

                            ## What is the output of the model? 

                            The output is a probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class. For binary classification problem P(y=1|x) and P(y=0|x)
                            
                            It is based on function `f(x) = w0 + w1x1+ w2x2 + …+ wnxn`      
                            
                            There is no MAGIC! We are learning these weights  `(w0, w1, w2, …, wn)`  based on training data

                            In other words, We should choose `w`  that based on it the predictions of the model is as close to true values `y` on the data we have  or We will pick `w` such that the error is minimized!

                            **Assumption?** Input data from the two classes (in case of binary classification) are separable using linear boundary

                            Overfitting: We can find a hypothesis that predicts perfectly the training data but does not generalize well to new data

                            The function ”memorizes” the data points, but is wild everywhere else.

                            Typical overfitting means that error on the training data is very low, but error on new instances is high

                            - Typical underfitting means that error on the training data is very high

                            5. How do make sense of a probabilistic world in the age of AI when humans expect deterministic results from machines? In other words, how do we deal, as a society, with the fact that AI doesn't yield perfect results even though we expect them to? Can we accept to live with mere probability?

                                  1. Working in teams of 2-3 or by yourself, think of an issue that is important to you (e.g. climate change, the refugee crisis, cancer) OR think of a problem you're facing at work (e.g. you need to identify donors for your new initiative). Brainstorm ways that Machine Learning may help with the issues you want to solve. 
                                  2. Try to find a dataset related to your issue that you could work with for today. Visit http://kaggle.com or http://opendata.gc.ca for Canadian Government datasets.
                                  3. Create a new project in Dataiku and import your new database. 
                                  4. Clean up your data if needed. 
                                  5. Follow the instructions from our Class Exercise to run a few Machine Learning models on your dataset. 
                                  6. What have you learned from your dataset?
